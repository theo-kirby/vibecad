"""Workbench-specific VibeCAD tool-pack metadata.

Each pack declares the explicit provider tool names it contributes to the
model-facing tool surface. The active provider surface is always the shared
core tool set plus the entered pack's ``tool_names``; packs with an empty
``tool_names`` tuple rely on the core tools (document/view inspection,
``core.list_workbench_objects``, workspace switching) alone.
